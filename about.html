      <h1>A Little Tale</h1>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in the small Anatolian city of Elazig in Turkey, a
        girl was born. Her mother named her Gülşah, which means "queen of roses"
        in Persian. Gülşah became the second and last child of the family. She
        also had an elder brother who was 7 years older than her. Her brother
        was her closest friend, they played games and had fun together.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day,her father said they needed to move to Izmir due to his job, and
        they moved when she was 4 years old. Gülşah made her first friendships
        in this city. This city taught her how to swim and ride a bicycle. For
        her, Izmir meant friendship, the sea, and cycling. When she was about to
        start her primary education, her family moved to Istanbul. For that
        7-year-old girl, Istanbul was dark and crowded. Luckily, she loved
        school, especially art, music, and literature classes. Colors and shapes
        were special to her, and drawing was the most beautiful thing that
        reflected her imagination. She was also interested in stories as much as
        drawing. She wrote a story about a child who lost her mother while she
        was still in the second grade, and the story made the whole class sad.
        She also received full marks from the teacher. She wanted to hear her
        drawings and writings, so she used music and started playing the bağlama
        at the age of 9.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years passed, and Gülşah added technology to her three interests. The
        magical world of the internet led her to decide to become a web
        developer. She thought that web pages could also be a work of art, and
        with the support of her closest friend, her brother, she chose to study
        computer science. University was a new universe for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        New friendships gave her different perspectives, and in her first year
        of university, she participated in many different volunteering projects.
        She found her life purpose through these projects. She would now
        constantly develop herself and contribute to the development of others
